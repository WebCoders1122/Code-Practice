        Jinnah served as the leader of the <strong>All-India Muslim League</strong> from 1913 until the <em>inception of Pakistan on 14 August 1947</em>, and then as the Dominion of Pakistan's first governor-general until his death. Baba-e-Qaum. Quaid-e-Azam.

        There are many ways to define this magnanimous figure in story of Pakistan, but these lines by Stanley Wolpert, a famous American Historian in his book "Jinnah of Pakistan" say it so well.
        Few individuals significantly alter the course of history. Fewer still modify the map of the world. Hardly anyone can be credited with creating a nation-state. Muhammad Ali Jinnah did all three."

            He has always been an inspiration to every Pakistani as 'father of nation' and more commonly as <strong>'Quaid e Azam' (the Great Leader)</strong>.</p>
        <p>
            Jinnah exhibited a certain sense of direction all along and was a powerful politician whose intelligent and smart political moves defeated both Indian National Congress and the might of British Empire in carving out a separate homeland for Muslims of Indian subcontinent. Interestingly, he achieved all this in matter of few years and did not allow any of moves by his adversaries to affect his mission.

            He didn't live long after Pakistan's independence but worked very hard after Pakistan got its independence and he ensured that he would give a sense of direction to this new nation which needed leadership amid all the crises created by manipulative regime of British and Indian government. Jinnah was clear about his vision for Pakistan and in his numerous speeches and addresses, he would articulate his vision clearly for everyone to stay focussed.

            His spoken words, vision and his thoughts are still revered by many as  guiding principles for his Pakistan.
